    <td>Aries</td>
    <td>
      <div>
        In Greek mythology, Aries is associated with the golden ram that rescued Phrixus and Helle, children of the Boeotian king Athamas. The ram's golden fleece was later sought by Jason and the Argonauts.
      </div>
    </td>
    <td>
      <div>
        The Roman mythological interpretation of Aries is similar to the Greek one, with the ram often being associated with Mars, the god of war, due to the sign's fiery and assertive nature.
      </div>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Taurus</td>
    <td>
      <div>
        Taurus is linked to the myth of Zeus transforming into a magnificent white bull to abduct Europa, a Phoenician princess. This act led to the birth of Minos and the eventual rise of the Minoan civilization.
      </div>
    </td>
    <td>
      <div>
        In Roman mythology, Taurus is also associated with a bull, often tied to the story of Jupiter (the Roman equivalent of Zeus) and his pursuit of Europa, emphasizing themes of desire and power.
      </div>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Gemini</td>
    <td>
      <div>
        Gemini represents the twins Castor and Pollux, known as the Dioscuri. They were brothers who shared the same mother, Leda, but had different fathers: Castor was mortal, and Pollux was divine, being the son of Zeus.
      </div>
    </td>
    <td>
      <div>
        The Roman version of Gemini also revolves around the twins Castor and Pollux, known as the Gemini twins. They were celebrated as protectors of sailors and were associated with the concept of brotherhood and camaraderie.
      </div>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Cancer</td>
    <td>
      <div>
        Cancer is associated with the giant crab Karkinos that Hera sent to distract Hercules during his fight with the Hydra. Although the crab was crushed by Hercules, Hera placed it in the sky to honor its service.
      </div>
    </td>
    <td>
      <div>
        The Roman myth of Cancer is similar to the Greek one, with the crab playing a role in the Twelve Labors of Hercules (Heracles in Greek). The crab's placement in the sky by Juno (Hera's Roman counterpart) signifies loyalty and sacrifice.
      </div>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Leo</td>
    <td>
      <div>
        Leo is connected to the Nemean Lion, a fearsome beast with impenetrable skin that Hercules was tasked to kill as his first labor. After slaying the lion, Hercules wore its skin as armor.
      </div>
    </td>
    <td>
      <div>
        In Roman mythology, Leo's story mirrors the Greek, with Hercules overcoming the Nemean Lion. The lion's representation in the sky symbolizes bravery, strength, and the heroic nature of the task.
      </div>
    </td>

  <tr>
    <td>Virgo</td>
    <td>
      <div>
        Virgo is often associated with the goddess of the harvest, Demeter, and her daughter Persephone. The myth of Persephone's abduction by Hades and the resulting seasonal change is central to Virgo's symbolism of fertility and renewal.
      </div>
    </td>
    <td>
      <div>
        The Roman equivalent of Virgo is linked to Ceres, the goddess of agriculture, and her daughter Proserpina. The story of Proserpina's abduction by Pluto reflects themes of innocence, purity, and the cyclical nature of life.
      </div>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Libra</td>
    <td>
      <div>
        Libra is associated with Themis, the Titaness of divine law and order. The scales of Libra symbolize the balance and fairness that Themis upheld, as well as the equinox when day and night are equal.
      </div>
    </td>
    <td>
      <div>
        In Roman culture, Libra is connected to Astraea, the goddess of justice and innocence, who was the last of the immortals to leave Earth. The scales represent the balance of justice and the importance of equilibrium.
      </div>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Scorpio</td>
    <td>
      <div>
        Scorpio is linked to the story of Orion, a giant huntsman whom Artemis placed among the stars as the constellation Orion. The scorpion that killed Orion was also placed in the sky by Gaia.
      </div>
    </td>
    <td>
      <div>
        The Roman myth of Scorpio is similar, with the scorpion being placed in the sky by Diana (the Roman equivalent of Artemis) after it killed Orion. The constellation represents the themes of death and transformation.
      </div>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Sagittarius</td>
    <td>
      <div>
        Sagittarius is often identified with the centaur Chiron, who was known for his wisdom and skill with the bow. Chiron, unlike other centaurs, was highly intelligent and tutored many Greek heroes.
      </div>
    </td>
    <td>
      <div>
        The Roman interpretation of Sagittarius also centers around Chiron, reflecting the qualities of education, healing, and the pursuit of knowledge, with the centaur's bow symbolizing the seeking of truth.
      </div>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Capricorn</td>
    <td>
      <div>
        Capricorn is associated with the goat Amalthea, who nourished the infant Zeus with her milk. The goat's broken horn, which Zeus transformed into the Cornucopia, symbolizes abundance and nurturance.
      </div>
    </td>
    <td>
      <div>
        In Roman mythology, Capricorn is linked to the god Pan, who transformed into a sea-goat to escape the monster Typhon. The sign represents discipline, wisdom, and the duality of the material and spiritual realms.
      </div>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Aquarius</td>
    <td>
      <div>
        Aquarius is represented by Ganymede, a beautiful young man who was carried off by Zeus in the form of an eagle to become the cupbearer of the gods, symbolizing the pouring out of knowledge and enlightenment.
      </div>
    </td>
    <td>
      <div>
        The Roman version of Aquarius also features Ganymede, known as the water-bearer. Jupiter (Zeus) brought Ganymede to the heavens, where he serves as a symbol of the distribution of wisdom and the flow of ideas.
      </div>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Pisces</td>
    <td>
      <div>

      </div>
    </td>
    <td>
      <div>
        In Roman mythology, Pisces is associated with Venus and Cupid, who turned into fish to evade the monster Typhon. The constellation symbolizes compassion, empathy, and the enduring nature of love.
